## 🎪 **Game Strategy Guide**

### **🎯 Winning Strategies**

**🎯 Line Victory Tactics:**
- **Corner Control**: Start in corners to create multiple line possibilities
- **Center Dominance**: Control the center squares for maximum flexibility  
- **Diagonal Threats**: Set up diagonal lines - they're harder to block
- **Double Threats**: Create two potential wins simultaneously

**🟦 Square Victory Tactics:**
- **Adjacent Pairs**: Place pieces in clusters, not scattered
- **Movement Preparation**: Set up pieces that can slide into square formation
- **Hidden Squares**: Build squares in unexpected positions
- **Bait & Switch**: Threaten a line while secretly building a square

### **🎮 Phase-by-Phase Strategy**

**📍 Placement Phase** (First 16 moves)
```
🎯 Your Goal: Position pieces for future movement flexibility
🛡️ Key Defense: Don't let opponent control too many adjacent squares
⚔️ Advanced Tip: Create "sleeping" formations that activate during movement
```

**🏃 Movement Phase** (After all pieces placed)
```
🎯 Your Goal: Slide pieces to complete winning formations  
🛡️ Key Defense: Block opponent's immediate threats while advancing your own
⚔️ Advanced Tip: Force opponent into defensive moves while you build offense
```
   ### **🎯 Pro Tips from the AI Team**

**🎯 AlphaStrategist's Advice:**
> "Master both win conditions! Too many players focus only on lines and miss square opportunities."

**🛡️ BetaDefender's Warning:**
> "Never ignore your opponent's threats. A good defense wins more games than pure offense."

**⚔️ GammaAggressor's Secret:**
> "Create chaos! When you force multiple threats, opponents crack under pressure."

**🧠 DeltaEvolver's Wisdom:**
> "Every game teaches you something. I learn from every match - so should you!"
